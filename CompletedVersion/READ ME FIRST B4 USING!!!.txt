put your question
in "Q.txt", use spaces on
each, uh, new number/exponent.
Example: if you put "3 * 2 - 5" without
quotation marks you get the awnser when you run the code.

Doesn't work if a negitive exponent is the first thing that 
appears in "Q.txt" (-66 + 65), but can calculate negitive 
awnsers (44 - 46 = -2).
