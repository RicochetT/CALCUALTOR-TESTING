put your question
in "Q.txt", use spaces on
each, uh, new number??
example: if you put "3 * 2 - 5" without
quotation marks you get the awnser when you run the code
             
		<------------------->

+ = Addition
- = Subtraction
* = Multiplication
/ = Division
Pi = Pi (note that only pi can be in 
equation not "3 Pi * 2" only allows "3 Pi")

Also Pi's awnser will be outputted in the console.
